prompt = """You are an expert in knowledge graph extraction.

The input is a chunk of text converted from a .docx file into Markdown format.
Your task is to extract **entities** and **relationships** from this chunk.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Ignore all Markdown formatting such as `#`, `**bold**`, `_italic_`, links `[text](url)`, image tags `![]()`, table syntax, and any width/height attributes.
2. Focus only on **factual content** in the text.
3. Entities must be explicitly present in the text. Do NOT fabricate names, organizations, locations, or products that are not mentioned.
4. **Always extract any meaningful identifiers or special terms**, including but not limited to:
    - Acronyms or abbreviations (e.g., "AMI", "EPI", "WHO", "ISO9001")
    - Technical codes or model numbers (e.g., "APIv2", "ECU-123")
    - Symbols or alphanumeric labels (e.g., "H2O", "pH7", "Section A1")
    - Domain-specific terms (medical, technical, legal, scientific, etc.) that function as distinct entities in the context
5. If both a full name and an abbreviated form appear, treat each as a separate entity if both are used meaningfully in the text.

**Canonicalization rules (apply to both entities and relationships):**
- Use the entity `name` **exactly as it appears in the text**, preserving case and punctuation; trim leading/trailing whitespace.
- Do **not** invent aliases, plural/singular variations, or paraphrases.
- Avoid duplicate entities with identical `name`. If duplicates arise, keep a single entry.

6. Entity attributes:
    - `id`: (will be assigned by system later)
    - `name`: The exact name as in the text
    - `type`: One of [Organization, Person, Location, Product, Event, Project, Document, Law, Date, Number, Other]
    - `description_node`:
        - `type`: "entity"
        - `text`: A short factual description of the entity from the text.
        - `embedding`: "Tạm thời chưa cần embedding"

7. Relationships must be explicitly stated or strongly implied in the text.
    - `id`: (will be assigned by system later)
    - `source`: the **name** of an entity that has already been extracted and listed in `entities`
    - `target`: the **name** of another entity that has already been extracted and listed in `entities`
    - `type`: A short relationship type (Partner, Owns, Uses, Located_In, Produces, Manufactures, Requires, etc.)
    - `description_node`:
        - `type`: "relationship"
        - `text`: Describe the relationship in one short factual sentence from the text
        - `embedding`: "Tạm thời chưa cần embedding"
    - **Hard constraints (must follow):**
        - `source` and `target` must be **exact string matches** (case-sensitive) to some `entities[i].name`.
        - Never output IDs (e.g., `entity_123`) or free text in `source`/`target`. Use **names only**.
        - If either `source` or `target` has **no exact match** in `entities[].name`, **omit** that relationship instead of guessing.

**Final consistency check before output (you must perform this):**
- Let `N = set(entities[].name)`.
- Set `relationships = [ r for r in relationships if r.source in N and r.target in N ]`.

8. If no entities or relationships are found, return empty arrays for both.

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Output **valid JSON only** (an object with keys `entities` and `relationships`), no markdown fences, no comments, no trailing commas, no extra fields.

### OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY)

  "relationships": []
